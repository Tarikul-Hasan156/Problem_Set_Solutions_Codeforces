# ðŸ§  Codeforces Problem Solutions

Welcome to my Codeforces Problem Solutions repository!

This repository contains my accepted solutions to problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/tarikul1234), one of the most popular competitive programming platforms. I use this space to keep track of my problem-solving progress and to improve my skills in data structures, algorithms, and coding under time constraints.

## ðŸ“Œ What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- âœ… Solutions to problems from Div. 1, Div. 2, Div. 3, Div 4 and Educational contests.
- ðŸ”¢ Problems solved using various algorithms (e.g., greedy, binary search, DFS/BFS, DP, etc.).
- ðŸ§® Languages used: Mainly C++.

## ðŸ“‚ Problem Naming Convention

In this repository, I follow a simple yet effective naming convention for each problem's solution.

### How It Works:
- Each problem is named based on its official problem title.
- The file name is a lowercase version of the problem name with spaces replaced by underscores and a `.cpp` extension.

### Example:
If the problem is titled **"Two Friends"**, you'll find its solution file named: **"two_friend.cpp"**

**"Thank You"**        [Click for exit ](https://github.com/Tarikul-Hasan156?tab=repositories)
